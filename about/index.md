Hello, I'm Jamal. I'm a software engineer based in Manchester, England. My background is in computer science; I have experience working in fast-paced start-up companies. I am fueled by my passion to understand user needs and to deliver technical solutions to hard to solve problems. Here I'll be writing about things I'm currently working on and things I'm interested in, both technical and non-technical.
